			<p class="statements">The Z-axis rod clamps were 3-D printed using
								  my own original design. They were tightened
								  around the two rods. The black baseplate frame
								  was salvaged from an older 3-D printer. The frame 
								  was bolted to the clamps to create the z-axis carriage.</p>
			<p class="statements">The threaded rod was inserted into a 3-D printed
								  axis coupler. The opposite end of the coupler hugged
								  the drive shaft of the stepper motor. Both ends
								  of the coupler were tightened.</p>
			<p class="statements">The dual purposed pieces are assembled using
								  a mostly salvaged axis and 3-D printed pieces.
								  A threaded hole end cap allows the axis to move vertically,
								  while the stepper motor and belt move horizontally.</p>
			<p class="statements">The three axis mock-ups were positioned while
								  final estimations were made. "Measure twice,
								  cut once" is every engineer's motto. Some minor
								  adjustments were made to the original plans.</p>
			<p class="statements">In structural integrity testing, flexion was
								  observed in the threaded y-axis rod. An
								  additional y-axis rod, motor, and coupler
								  unit was added to the opposite side for stabalization.</p>
			<p class="statements">Safety measures are always considered
								  in the workshop. Safety glasses are worn
								  and a workshop buddy is present in case of emergency.
								  These are especially considered when using power tools.</p>
			<p class="statements">The first part of the frame consists of two pieces of 2x2
								  cut to the same length, with three holes bored in each to
								  support the z and y axes. For stability, three,
								  1x4 cross beams connected the two main, wooden rails.</p>
			<p class="statements">The y-Axis lifting motor and threaded rod system was
								  strategically screwed to the frame using a 3-D printed bracket.
								  The x/y Axis carriage slid on the two support rods.
								  Finally, the threaded y-axis rod was twisted into the carriage.</p>
			<p class="statements">A recycled, heated print bed was nestled into the base
								  plate frame. Its wires were run underneath the whole system
								  and out to the side. Similarly, all of the motor
								  and extruder wires were run down and over to the same side.</p>
			<p class="statements">A second, wooden ladder, frame piece was built to house the
								  printer's control board. Using 3-D printed brackets, the two frame
								  were bolted together. All the wires were plugged into the RAMPS
								  board and it was fastened to the bottom-most support beams.</p>
