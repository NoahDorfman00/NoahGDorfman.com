The black baseplate frame was salvaged from an older 3-D printer. The frame was bolted to the clamps to create the z-axis carriage."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer2.jpg","Y-Axis Motor with Threaded Rod","The threaded rod was inserted into a 3-D printed axis coupler. The opposite end of the coupler hugged the drive shaft of the stepper motor. Both ends of the coupler were tightened."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer3.jpg","X-Axis and Y-Axis Carriage","The dual purposed pieces are assembled using a mostly salvaged axis and 3-D printed pieces. A threaded hole end cap allows the axis to move vertically, while the stepper motor and belt move horizontally."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer4.jpg","Final Preparations Prior to Combining the Three Axes",'The three axis mock-ups were positioned while final estimations were made. "Measure twice, cut once" is the engineering mantra. Some minor adjustments were made to the original plans.'],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer5.jpg","Revision of Y-Axis Design","In structural integrity testing, flexion was observed in the threaded y-axis rod. An additional y-axis rod, motor, and coupler unit was added to the opposite side for stabalization."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer6.JPG","Bring Out the Power Tools for Frame Assembly","Safety measures are always considered in the workshop. Safety glasses are worn and a workshop buddy is present in case of emergency. These are especially considered when using power tools."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer7.JPG","Wooden Ladder Frame Design","The first part of the frame consists of two pieces of 2x2 cut to the same length, with three holes bored in each to support the z and y axes. For stability, three, 1x4 cross beams connected the two main, wooden rails."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer8.JPG","X and Y Axes Installed on Frame","The y-Axis lifting motor and threaded rod system was strategically screwed to the frame using a 3-D printed bracket. The x/y Axis carriage slid on the two support rods. Finally, the threaded y-axis rod was twisted into the carriage."],
		["tall","../images/printer/printer9.jpg","Heated Printing Bed Installed and Wires Managed","A recycled, heated print bed was nestled into the base plate frame. Its wires were run underneath the whole system and out to the side. Similarly, all of the motor and extruder wires were run down and over to the same side."],
		["short","../images/printer/printer10.JPG","RAMPS Controller Board Installed with Secondary Ladder Frame","A second, wooden ladder, frame piece was built to house the printer's control board. Using 3-D printed brackets, the two frame were bolted together. All the wires were plugged into the RAMPS board and it was fastened to the bottom-most support beams."]
