	["Mr. Baldwin it really is an honor to meet you. I’ve noticed that we have quite a bit in common and I’ve wanted a chance to talk with you. You know, the media really picks both of us apart. Many times, they’ll question me like “Who have you chosen to do this interview?” They seem to believe that I need some deeper meaning behind everything I do. Why can’t I just do an interview with a music paper because I’m a musician? Do you feel like the media also attacks you? What do they come at you for?",
		"dyl", "", "", "no"],//2
	["I agree with you, and please, call me James. It is very common for people to attack me about my sexuality. If you’ve read any of my literature, it’s clear that I explore various intricacies of sexuality in addition to other themes like race and politics. This has led many to question my sexuality. Now, with any chance they get, they ask me to come out or what advice I would give. I believe sexuality is between a man and himself and I shouldn’t have to share publicly about it. I’ve loved some men and some women and there is no need for a label. How do you believe they attack you?",
		"bal",
		"Focus on Sales, Not Music",
		"Outrage Over My Music",
		 "yes"],//3
	["They ask so much about money and record sales and never about the music. I can sell my records just fine without doing interviews and pushing themselves. My music speaks for itself so why would I want to be hassled? And on the off chance they do talk about the music they try to have me talk about the non-existent true meanings. I know you do have deeper meaning to your works. How does that change them inquiring about it?",
		"dyl", "", "", "no"],//4
	["One of the biggest rages against me was when I went electric. Many critics in the media HATED it. You know, I’m just making the music that speaks to me. I’m not trying to meet an image or make sales; I’m just doing what speaks to me. If I can’t make music that I’m passionate about, why bother?",
		 "dyl", "", "", "no"],//5
	["That’s an interesting question. I suppose they don’t focus on critiquing or analyzing my deeper meaning too much directly to me. It’s expected to come with my work. They do however critique how I write it and include the content. Sometimes my critics say that I write too candidly and that I shouldn’t have written my book at all. I was told it was going to wreck my career.",
		"bal",
		"Similarities Between Us",
		"Future Inspiration",

	["I can relate to that. When I had my electric music debut, I had people tell my that I was a traitor to folk music and that I was ending my career by turning away from my fans. I just wanted to have fun and make the music that I had passion to create. I think its cool that a folk musician and an author experience such similar treatment by the media. Thanks for sharing your experience with me. I bet I’m better than the damn media!", 
		"dyl", "", "", "no"],//7
	["Hearing that yourself, a man I respect so much, goes through the same challenges I do with the media lights a fire in me. It must mean that I’m making good work that means something, even if that meaning isn’t set in stone. I’m going to keep on going with the flow!",
		 "dyl", "", "", "no"],//8
	["I’ll give you some of the best advice I’ve ever received. You have to go the way your blood beats. If you don’t live the only life you have, you won’t live some other life, you won’t live any life at all. If you are passionate about your music, disregard what others think. Make your music for the right reasons. The ones that fulfill you.",
		"bal",
		"Future Inspiration",
		"Similarities Between Us",

	["Thank you James. I’m really going to take that to heart. It gets hard when the media and critics are constantly telling you what your music is supposed to sound like or mean. You’re giving me motivation to keep doing my own thing and follow my passion through music.",

	["Mr. Baldwin it really is an honor to meet you. I’ve noticed that we have quite a bit in common and I’ve wanted a chance to talk with you. The way I see it, the media paints us both as the figureheads of movements when neither of us are asking for that. You are painted as an author for the civil rights movement and my songs are viewed as protest songs. How do you view yourself?",

	["I like to say that I am an observer. I am not a key player in the events at hand, I simply observe from a distance and offer an outside perspective on the state of the nation.

I am friends with Martin and Malcolm, but they are doing and sacrificing more for the movement than I could ever dream of.",
		"bal",
		"Idea of an Observer",
		"Who I Think I Am",

	["That idea of an observer is very interesting to me. I like to simply write the songs that I want to write. I don’t shape my music or work around the argument of a movement, I do it for me. That seems very similar to your idea of being an observer. You aren’t really trying to change the events at hand, you are just writing about what you are seeing and analyzing them.",
		"dyl", "", "", "no"],//14
	["People always ask me if I think that I’m the face of these movements. If I thought I was that person, wouldn’t I be out there doing it? Wouldn’t I be, if I thought I was meant to do that, wouldn’t I be doing it? I don’t have to hold back. This Maharishi, he thinks that– right? He’s out there doing it. If I thought that, I’d be out there doing it. Don’t you … you agree, right? So obviously, I don’t think that.",
		"dyl", "", "", "no"],//15
	["You know Bob, you must go the way your blood beats. If you don’t live the only life you have, you won’t live some other life, you won’t live any life at all.

Likewise, if I was truly the face of an organization, wouldn’t I be writing pieces favoring such movements? Wouldn’t more bias be present in my work?", "bal",
