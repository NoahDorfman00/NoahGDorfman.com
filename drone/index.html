			<p class="statements">This custom model consists of:
								  Naze32Rev6 Flight Controller, 3S LiPo Battery,
								  Versacopter V2 Frame Kit from FliteTest.com,
								  Spektrum Radio Reciever and Transmitter,
								  and Electronics Pack E from FliteTest.com.</p>
			<p class="statements">Tools were gathered including: soldering equipment,
								  screwdrivers, alan wrenches, pliers, wire strippers,
								  and electrical tape. Quadcopter parts
								  were organized and prepared for assembly.</p>
			<p class="statements">The XT60 battery connector was soldered to
								  two of the largest solder pads on the PDB.
								  The four Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)
								  were soldered to their respective pads.</p>
			<p class="statements">The Delrin walls of the body were
								  pieced together and mounted to the PDB
								  with bolts. Four boom clamps were
								  also loosely tightened on at this point.</p>
			<p class="statements">The ten inch booms were snugly fit
								  through the boom clamps. They were then
								  measured to insure symmetry. Finally,
								  the four boom clamps were tightened.</p>
			<p class="statements">The motor clamps were loosely screwed to
								  the motors, and snugly slid on the booms.
								  The motors were alligned using a level surface
								  to ensure even flight. Finally, screws were tightened.</p>
			<p class="statements">All of the pins were soldered to the 
								  flight controller board. The color coded
								  jumper leads were pressed into place and
								  secured with foam tape to endure crashes.</p>
			<p class="statements">The radio receiver was plugged into it's
								  respective flight controller leads and
								  the ESCs were plugged into their respective motors. 
								  The battery was plugged in and it booted successfully.</p>
			<p class="statements">The Clean Flight Google application was installed
								  and booted. The Quadcopter was plugged in
								  via USB, flight data was configured, and
								  gyroscopic sensors were calibrated.</p>
			<p class="statements">Following instructions from the manual,
								  the transmitter remote was bound to the quadcopter.
								  The body was buttoned up with the electronics
								  inside, and the propellors were twisted on.</p>
			<p class="statements">The local Glassboro town square is a
								  great place to fly. It is rarely busy,
								  there is a lot of open space, and the ground
								  is mostly soft grass to decrease crash damage.</p>
			<p class="statements">The motors armed at the flick of a switch,
								  and the propellors twirled. With increase
								  of throttle and steadying of yaw, pitch,
								  and roll; the drone took flight.</p>
			<p class="statements">After some tweaked settings and a few
								  practice flights, human error was reduced
								  and the quadopter could fly for almost 15
								  minutes without incident.</p>
			<p class="statements">For the very first of the quadcopter, the
								  radio transmitter had complete control over
								  its movement. This, combined with weak pilot
								  skill resulted in a crash.</p>
			<p class="statements">After a crash into grass, the Versacopter V2
								  has no unfixable damages. The only problems that
								  might arise are broken propellors (cheap to replace)
								  and unalligned motors (fixable with a wrench).</p>
