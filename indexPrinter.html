			<p class="statements">The Z-axis rod clamps were 3-D printed using<br/>
								  my own original design. They were tightened<br/>
								  around the two rods. The black baseplate frame<br/>
								  was salvaged from an older 3-D printer. The frame <br/>
								  was bolted to the clamps to create the z-axis carriage.</p>
			<p class="statements">The threaded rod was inserted into a 3-D printed<br/>
								  axis coupler. The opposite end of the coupler hugged<br/>
								  the drive shaft of the stepper motor. Both ends<br/>
								  of the coupler were tightened.</p>
			<p class="statements">The dual purposed pieces are assembled using<br/>
								  a mostly salvaged axis and 3-D printed pieces.<br/>
								  A threaded hole end cap allows the axis to move vertically,<br/>
								  while the stepper motor and belt move horizontally.</p>
			<p class="statements">The three axis mock-ups were positioned while<br/>
								  final estimations were made. "Measure twice,<br/>
								  cut once" is every engineer's motto. Some minor<br/>
								  adjustments were made to the original plans.</p>
			<p class="statements">In structural integrity testing, flexion was<br/>
								  observed in the threaded y-axis rod. An<br/>
								  additional y-axis rod, motor, and coupler<br/>
								  unit was added to the opposite side for stabalization.</p>
			<p class="statements">Safety measures are always considered<br/>
								  in the workshop. Safety glasses are worn<br/>
								  and a workshop buddy is present in case of emergency.<br/>
								  These are especially considered when using power tools.</p>
			<p class="statements">The first part of the frame consists of two pieces of 2x2<br/>
								  cut to the same length, with three holes bored in each to<br/>
								  support the z and y axes. For stability, three,<br/>
								  1x4 cross beams connected the two main, wooden rails.</p>
			<p class="statements">The y-Axis lifting motor and threaded rod system was<br/>
								  strategically screwed to the frame using a 3-D printed bracket.<br/>
								  The x/y Axis carriage slid on the two support rods.<br/>
								  Finally, the threaded y-axis rod was twisted into the carriage.</p>
			<p class="statements">A recycled, heated print bed was nestled into the base<br/>
								  plate frame. Its wires were run underneath the whole system<br/>
								  and out to the side. Similarly, all of the motor<br/>
								  and extruder wires were run down and over to the same side.</p>
			<p class="statements">A second, wooden ladder, frame piece was built to house the<br/>
								  printer's control board. Using 3-D printed brackets, the two frame<br/>
								  were bolted together. All the wires were plugged into the RAMPS<br/>
								  board and it was fastened to the bottom-most support beams.</p>
