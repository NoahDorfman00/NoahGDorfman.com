		["short","../images/morse/morse1.JPG","Glassboro West Jersey Depot and the Telegraph","A Modern Twist on an Old Classic","Glassboro Historical Society has recently renovated the West Jersey Train Depot into a museum for Glassboro's history with trains. The museum contains information and artifacts from an era when the station functioned. The museum has an original telegraph from the 1800's."],
		["tall","../images/morse/morse2.JPG","Connecting the Two Devices Efficiently","The historical society imagined a device to make learning, the lost language of Morse Code, easier for the populus. After tinkering with the machine a solution was developed to break down the learning barrier."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse3.JPG","Connecting the Two Devices Efficiently","In the original plans, using Wi-Fi seemed like the best solution to connect two digital devices in separate rooms. Over the course of development, method of connectivity transitioned from Wi-Fi, to Bluetooth, and finally using a direct wire between the two devices."],
		["tall","../images/morse/morse4.JPG","Preserving History","Another challenge was reading a morse code signal without tampering with the original circuitry of the telegraph. The issue was circumnavigated using an external, digital button that the telegraph's arm could press as it performs its usual task."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse5.JPG","Schematic of the the Top of the Desk at each Telegraph Station","Each station would have a tactile button under the telegraph's arm. Its wiring would be run under the desk to the 'brain' of the system. A monitor for displaying a translation of Morse Code to text would sit on the desk with an HDMI cord run underneath."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse6.JPG","Inside the Desk Schematic","Under each station, a Raspberry Pi 3 was used to control the system. A pull-down circuit was constructed to regulate button presses before entering the interfacing pins on the Raspberry Pi. The HDMI cord and button wires were run up to the top level."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse8.JPG","Planning the Budget","After designing the build with historical society approval, a budget was drafted to present to the committee. Not only practical for the scope, the preliminary budget was approved as an efficient use of money by the society."],
		["tall","../images/morse/morse9.jpg","Learning to Build a Pull-Down Circuit",'To incorporate the tactile button, I taught myself to build a pull-down circuit using an Arduino microcontroller. The pull-down circuit regulates button presses to only provide an on and off signal, no "medium signals".'],
		["short","../images/morse/morse10.jpg","Producing Custom Pull-Down Circuit Boards",'Finally, it was time to begin building and coding. At this stage, it was decided to make one machine the "sender" and one the "reciever". This simplified the build for users and for the developer. The circuits were soldered and plugged into the Raspberry Pi.'],
		["tall","../images/morse/morse11.jpg","Keeping Morse Code Tradition","Keeping the theme of maintaining historic value, the historic society's morse code expert explained the timing of Morse Code and how to properly send messages. This data was incorporated in the algorithm."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse12.jpg","Beta Version of the Morse Code Translation Software","Using a personally owned Raspberry Pi, the Python based software was built into a functioning beta. Taking button presses as input and displaying translated text."],
		["vid","","Functioning Algorithm with Tweaked Timings","After the beta version was presented to the historic society, the button press timescale needed adjusting. A new version of the build with proper timing and a more descriptive display is shown in action."],
		["short","../images/morse/morse13.JPG",'"Final" Build Being Configured for Two Machines','A user interface and socket connection script were added to the build. Finally, the machines were ready for connectivity between each other. Though, the build was "finalized", it will be improved upon in the near future.'],
		["short","../images/morse/morse14.JPG","Ready for Museum Installation",'Using a "crossed" ethernet connection between the two devices. Data could be transmitted fluently. The final tests prevailed in an identical configuration to the real setup in the museum.']
