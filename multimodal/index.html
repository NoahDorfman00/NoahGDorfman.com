		<a style="FONT-SIZE:17px; LINE-HEIGHT:30px;"><b>Introduction</b></br>
	The folk genre of music is much closer to spoken word poetry than casual listening music. Folk music is usually known as a means of telling stories or delivering a message to the listening audience with the help of a few instruments to carry the rhythm. In the early 1960s, Bob Dylan fit this “cookie cutter” description of a folk artist to the tee. The classic folk style can be heard in his track, <i>Blowin’ In the Wind</i>:</br></a>

			As can be heard, Bob’s early music featured his lonesome voice, accompanied by an acoustic guitar and often a harmonica. He sung tales of his past and creatively mentioned ideas of the 60s era. In his early albums such as, <i>The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan</i> and <i>Bob Dylan</i>, he made reference to civil rights issues, politics, and other controversial topics. During the 1960s era of social change, artists like Dylan were labeled as “protest singers”. This was quite a fair judgement due to the nature of their music, which was littered with all sorts of notions toward the events that were taking place at this time. In fact, many of the coined, “protest singers”, were asked to perform and complied to performing at rallies, marches, and other radical meetings in support of varying causes. On the other hand, Bob Dylan was not so eager to accept his role in the political machine. He is quoted in a few interviews denying his affiliations to different organizations and in an interview with TIME Magazine he denies that his songs have any intentional motivation or message behind them:</a>

		<a style="FONT-SIZE:17px; LINE-HEIGHT:30px;"></br>Disregarding Bob Dylan’s claim that he is not a “protest singer”, I believe his music from the 1960s contains much meaning and background ideas that beg to differ. This essay will explore this idea by analyzing Dylan’s musical works and their correlations with a variety of ideas.</br></br></a>

</b></br>
	When Bob Dylan’s career took off around 1962, he was very much the definition of a folk singer. His songs told narratives about experiences of his own or of a fictional character. These tales highlighted and alluded to political and social ideas that were pertinent to the time period. In an article on the Folk Protest Movement, James Dunlap writes, “Dylan's first efforts, may not have had a chorus at all. By telling an educational story, rhetorical songs drew attention to a single incident or political issue.” A great first example of this can be found in Dylan’s song, <i>Oxford Town</i>:</br></a>

	<i>Oxford Town</i> is clearly about a racist encounter, in which a black man is running through Oxford, Mississippi in fear of his life. He stops at multiple buildings to escape the armed mob following him, but no one will let him inside because of his skin color. Bob Dylan’s lyrics read, “[Verse 2] He went down to Oxford Town / Guns and clubs followed him down / All because his face was brown / Better get away from Oxford Town”, “[Verse 3] Oxford Town around the bend / Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in / All because of the color of his skin / What do you think about that, my friend?”. Unfortunately, during this time period it was commonplace for people to turn a blind eye to violent racism. Bob Dylan wrote the entire song, <i>Oxford Town</i>, to highlight this issue for the public to see. Another outstanding example of direct political influence can be found in Dylan’s, <i>Masters of War</i>:</br></a>

	Bob Dylan sings on the topic of war in his, <i>Masters of War</i>. He calls out to the “masters of war” (government officials, politicians, etc.) saying that he can “see through [their] masks”. Dylan calls the government out for causing all of this havoc, “[Verse 1] You that build the big guns / You that build the death planes / You that build all the bombs,” and then says the politicians hide while it all unfolds, “[Verse 2] And you hide from my eyes / And you turn and run farther / When the fast bullets fly”. Some who listen to the track say it is specifically about the United States government during the Vietnam War era (1955-1975). Although this specificity can be debated, in general it is well understood that this song is about war times.</br></br><b>Late Bob Dylan
</b></br>The meaning behind Bob Dylan’s lyrics developed with him as he evolved through musical genres. After his transition to a folk rock style, some of his tracks focused more on self reflection and personal ideas. Whether from the point of view of himself, the listener, or a different character, Dylan wrote about American idealism, nature, and romantics. In a section of his article titled, <i>Dylan’s Rhetoric and Magnetism</i>, James Dunlap is quoted, “Like the transcendentalists, Dylan wrote that all thoughts can be traced back to nature, the reflection of a perfect mind. In “11 Outlined Epitaphs” (the album notes to his third album, The Times They Are A‐Changin’), he wrote, “[I]nfluences?/hundreds thousands/perhaps millions/for all songs lead back t’ the sea/an’ at one time, there was no singin’ tongue t'imitate it” (Writings 112)”. On the same album these notes were written on, the title track, <i>The Times They Are a-Changin’</i> is about accepting the world around you and rolling with the changing world:</br></a>

	Dylan sings, “As the present now will later be past / The order is rapidly fading / And the first one now will later be last / For the times they are a-changin'”. It can be interpreted that Bob Dylan is writing about himself and how he has changed his musical identity to match the rapidly changing popularity of the rock genre. Conversely, the listener can relate to the lyrics as if they were the ones who, “better start swimmin' or you’ll sink like a stone / For the times they are a-changin'”. Listeners can also imagine themselves as the target of Bob Dylan’s, <i>Like a Rolling Stone</i>:</br></a>

	Dylan’s use of second person perspective in this song allows listeners to reflect on themselves. He shouts, “How does it feel?”; asking the listener to think about how it feels to be down and out after taking things in their life for granted. In the first verse Bob Dylan sings, “Once upon a time you dressed so fine / Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? / People call, say / "Beware doll, you're bound to fall" / You thought they were all a'kiddin' you / You used to laugh about / Everybody that was hangin' out / Now you don't talk so loud / Now you don't seem so proud / About having to be scrounging your next meal”. This sort of self-reflection is very similar to the transcendentalist thoughts of Ralph Waldo Emerson about human ideals, which James Dunlap references in his essay, <i>Through the Eyes of Tom Joad: Patterns of American Idealism, Bob Dylan, and the Folk Protest Movement</i>. These complex thoughts are very different than Dylan’s earlier political and social commentary; nonetheless, his lyrics do in fact have meaning behind them.</br></br></a>
	<a style="FONT-SIZE:17px; LINE-HEIGHT:30px;"><b>Conclusion
</b></br>
	From this brief selection of Bob Dylan pieces, it is easy to see that his songs have much more than no substance. Songs such as <i>The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll</i>, <i>Oxford Town</i>, and <i>Maggie’s Farm</i> can be related to the civil rights movement; <i>Masters of War</i> and <i>A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall</i> are clearly about war politics. The fact is, this is just the tip of the iceberg for Bob Dylan and all sorts of other music. Most songs have some form of purpose, either hidden in the lyrics or in plain sight for the listener.</br></br></br></a>
